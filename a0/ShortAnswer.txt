1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Answer: This approach is misleading to quantify similarity between two users since the friend_overlap function gives the common friends which follow those 2 users. However, twitter allows anyone to follow a particular person.

In order to fix it, we need to look at the common people followed by 2 users so that we can quantify similarity between them.



2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

Hillary CLinton is following Magic Johnson since he supported her campaign. And also he is open to do business with Donald Trump, so he might also be interested.



3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?


There would not be fair comparison while doing analysis.




4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Answer: Total friends = 8073
        Total 15 requests in 15 mins, thus

        Total time = 8073/15 = 538.2 mins
