# # CS579: Assignment 1
#
# In this assignment, we'll implement community detection and link prediction algorithms using Facebook "like" data.
#
# The file `edges.txt.gz` indicates like relationships between facebook users. This was collected using snowball sampling: beginning with the user "Bill Gates", I crawled all the people he "likes", then, for each newly discovered user, I crawled all the people they liked.
#
# We'll cluster the resulting graph into communities, as well as recommend friends for Bill Gates.
#
# Complete the **15** methods below that are indicated by `TODO`. I've provided some sample output to help guide your implementation.


# You should not use any imports not listed here:
from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque
import copy
import math
import networkx as nx
import urllib.request

def bfs(graph, root, max_depth):

    Perform breadth-first search to compute the shortest paths from a root node to all

    the search after the specified depth.
    E.g., if max_depth=2, only paths of length 2 or less will be considered.
    This means that nodes greather than max_depth distance from the root will not
    appear in the result.

    Returns:
      A list of tuples in descending order of score. Ties are broken by
      alphabetical order of the terminal node in the edge.

    In this example below, we remove edge (D, F) from the
    example graph. The top two edges to add according to path_score are
    (D, F), with score 0.5, and (D, A), with score .25. (Note that (D, C)
    is tied with a score of .25, but (D, A) is first alphabetically.)

    >>> path_score(train_graph, 'D', k=4, beta=.5)
    [(('D', 'F'), 0.5), (('D', 'A'), 0.25), (('D', 'C'), 0.25)]
