Description of assignment:

In this assignment, I have analyzed the tweets about the recently released movie "Dear Zindagi". I have collected all the tweets which mentioned the movie name and then clustered based on the mentions in their tweets. Later I classified them based on the negative and postive sentiments used in the tweets. 

The aim of this analysis was to know the review of the movie and try to see what might have credited to the success or failure of the same.

File 1: collect.py

In this file, I have collected all the tweets using the Twitter API's search filter. Also I have made sure that the tweets are not repeated. The number of queries made are 10 in order to collect data quickly.

File 2: cluster.py

In this file, I have filtered out those tweets which has @ in it, then I stored the link between the user and the mentioned user in his/her tweet. Also, I made sure that the celebreties accounts starring in the movie are removed from these since we do not want the promotion tweets.
After forming these links, I have created a graph and ran girvan_newman algorithm on it to create the communities.

I wished to cluster it in a such a way that users who have mentioned the casts starring in the movie would be in single cluster, that way we would know that the actors/actresses play a major role in making the movie a success/fail

File 3: classify.py

In this file, I have done the sentiment analysis of the tweets using AFINN dataset. the tweets are classified according to the scores and then classified accordingly.

File 4: summary.txt

In this file, I have summarized the output of above files and stored in summary.txt
